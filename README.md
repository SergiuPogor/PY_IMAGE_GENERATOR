## Effects
<details>
<summary><b>Gradient Effects </b></summary>
Instead of using a solid color for each circle, you can create gradient effects by generating random colors within a certain range and smoothly transitioning the colors from one circle to another.

    python src/gradient_effects.py

Examples:

<details>
<summary><b>Random Shapes </b></summary>
Instead of circles, you can experiment with drawing random shapes such as squares, triangles, or polygons at different positions and sizes. You can also combine multiple shapes to create more complex patterns.

    python src/random_shapes.py

Examples:
